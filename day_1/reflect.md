# Day_1:

Actually, i have learnt it for about 5 days. The syntaxes is fine and somewhat more friendly than C/C++. However, unlike Python, it can be more flexible when using with variables/data types. In C/C++, we can use "for (int i = 0; i < sqrt(x); i++)" --> no error, in Go, the data types is a kind of very complex situation to deal with.

Another example in Python, if the program asks: "input an int to continue the loops, input letter "x" to exit" --> error in Go because it is a conflict type of data.

However, this Go stuff is kind of interesting. I think it will be a very wonderful journey for meh :)))
