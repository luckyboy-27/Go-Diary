# Go OOP

Note: In Go, we have values instead of objects (traditional oop languages).

In Go, we can use "pass by refference" and access by refferences with various names.
Objects with "INHERITANCE" or "Sub-class" --> can not use it in Go.
Therefore, we should not care about the constraints with objects and should focus on using it correctly

# Objects vs Values


1. Go doesnt have class, we can use struct instead
2. Method is a function declared only for a special data type. This type is called receiver argument written between func and method (its name). 
3. Receiver argument can be struct or non struct, it must be ready to access inside method.
